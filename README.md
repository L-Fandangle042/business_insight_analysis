This is the link to the business insight streamlit application I wrote using Python:

🚀 https://metrics-demo.streamlit.app/ 🚀

The application and visualisations were designed to use a constant stream of new and updated data so as to be changeable day by day or any point in which new data is added or the current data is edited.

I had a lot of fun making this as it was good practice for my preferred language (Python) and I wanted to practice something I felt would be useful for an employer.

Thank you for taking the time to have a look and please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions. 🙏
